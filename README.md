When plotting with n = 15 the primes consistently become more and more scarce as you approach the target number, 
in this case, 10^7. However, when I began running tests of other numbers things got interesting. I first tried n = 2 
and it produced exactly what I expecting the first bar slightly higher than the second. It is when I began running 
large numbers of n that something really caught my eye. The trend clearly slopes down, however, it is not consistent. 
There are what appears to be, inconsistent “spikes” in the data. After looking closer I came to the conjecture that 
as a trend the primes spread out, however, the exact pattern is random.
